Welcome to my GitHub portfolio I'm Jake French, a Development Engineer with a focus on product innovation and technology solutions. 
Here, you'll find a collection of my projects showcasing my work across electronics, data science, machine learning and software development. 

In addition to my portfolio, this GitHub also functions as my notebook, where I document ideas, experiments, and insights gained along my journey. I believe in continuous learning and collaboration, so feel free to explore, engage, and reach out for discussions or potential collaborations.
